    <p class="text">I am a student in Digital Media from Dasein Academy of Art. I chose to enroll in this program because I have an interest for both art and technology. The subject I look forward to learning the most is video production, as I have an interest in creating music videos. I have a love for music, and I often enjoy noticing the clever details and storytelling techniques used to make a song impactful.
    <br><br>
    However, I don't have the motivation that I'd need to strive in this field. The place where I'm more willing to put greater effort into lies in game development. So far, I have only gotten used to coding visual novels, and hope to learn a wider variety of games to create. However, my aim is not to make a money-earning career out of this skill, as my biggest priority when it comes to creating games is to have my own autonomy. I never wish to get hired to create addictive games or cash grabbers. While I do enjoy games purely meant for fun as well, I find it meaningless to solely create games that have a lack of depth. The true heart lies in something that I'd spend eternity perfecting, and that is the storytelling aspect of art creation.
    <br><br>
    This passion first sparked when I realised my love for story-based games. It fascinates me how we can dive into something attractive and engaging with the expectation of escaping reality, but come out with a deeper understanding of our own real lives, no matter how fantastical the stories can be. This brings me back to when I first entered Dasein. I was confused when the head lecturer highlighted that our mission as Digital Media students is to create artwork that solves problems in the real world, it gave off the impression that this program is overly practical. I never realised that this has been my goal all along, to inspire others just as how stories have inspired me.
    <br><br>
    My aspiration is to create fictional stories that can enhance others' realities. No matter how often I feel stuck in my own struggles, I hope that I will always be able to overcome them, and use them as inspiration to create art that can speak to others.
