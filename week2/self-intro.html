    <p class="text">I am a student in Digital Media from Dasein Academy of Art. I chose to enroll in this program because I have an interest for both art and technology. The subject I look forward to learning the most is video production, as I have an interest in creating music videos. I have a love for music, and I often enjoy noticing the clever details and storytelling techniques used to make a song impactful.
    <br><br>
    However, the place where I'm more willing to put greater effort into lies in game development. So far, I have only gotten used to coding visual novels, and hope to learn a wider variety of games to create. However, I prefer to create games as an indie developer, as I never wish to get hired to create addictive games or cash grabbers. While I do enjoy games purely meant for fun as well, I find it meaningless to solely create games that have a lack of depth. The true heart lies in something that I'd spend eternity perfecting, and that is the storytelling aspect of art creation.
    <br><br>
    It fascinates me how we can dive into something attractive and engaging with the expectation of escaping reality, but come out with a deeper understanding of our own real lives, no matter how fantastical the stories can be. That is why my aspiration is to create fictional stories that can enhance others' realities. No matter how often I feel stuck in my own life struggles, I hope that I will always be able to overcome them, and use them as inspiration to create art that can speak to others.
